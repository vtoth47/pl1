# My personal directions request

First, explore the various options through the Directions API https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-directions. 

Be creative and use multiple parameters from the API documentation to earn a top grade. The rubric is listed in the bottom of the MarkDown document. 

> Tip: Can't make changes? GitHub previews MD documents by default (read-only). Start editing to make the changes for your URL and JSON response below
